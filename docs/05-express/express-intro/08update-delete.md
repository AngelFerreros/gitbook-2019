# Update / Delete

We aren't adding any new concepts when we add the rest of CRUD / rest of the HTTP verbs, but the process of each verb has many steps that must be completed by the server and client.

### Updating
1. (Assume user has already created something that is stored as data )
1. User requests the form to edit that thing
