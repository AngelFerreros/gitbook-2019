# Intro to Pure Javascript
![](from here: https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/js-intro/blob/master/readme.md)

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the role Javascript plays alongside HTML and CSS


## Framing (5 minutes / 0:05)
- These will be the basics of writing the javascript language.
- These concepts are actually the same througout all computer languages.
- we'll be working inside the browser today, but javascript can be run independently.

## Javascript: The Client-Side Programming Language of the Web (5 Minutes / 0:20)

<strong>What's a programming language? What can it do that a markup language like HTML can't?</strong></summary>

  > It lets us do things! It lets us act on information, manipulate it, display it, pretty much whatever we want.
  >
  > Javascript enables us to do all that in a browser (i.e., client-side) using the tools you learned in the pre-work like data types, loops and functions.


Brief history: Javascript was created in 10 days by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) of Netscape/Mozilla.
* The programming language is not related to Java in any way but its name. "Java" is to "Javascript" as "ham" is to "hamster."
* Javascript has since gone through multiple iterations, the latest being ECMA Script 6 (ES6/2015)

### Why is it the dominant programming language of the web?


---

Barriers to entry for learning Javascript are very low. No additional software required to run it. Just a text editor and a browser.
- You can even run it directly in the browser via its Javascript console
- Ex. hide images on ESPN website

Javascript is supported by all web browsers.
- [Some browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs) support more features than others

Javascript continues to evolve.
- One of the biggest additions to the language was AJAX, which allows use to reload parts of a page without refreshing the entire thing. This had huge implications for user experience.

A lot of Javascript frameworks and libraries (e.g., jQuery, React) have emerged that enable us to do so much more with Javascript (and do it quickly).

## Setting Up Our Environment (5 minutes / 0:25)

We're going to spend the next few minutes learning how to set up our development environment, or our work area for working with Javascript. As far as development environments go, this is about as simple as it gets! If it feels unfamiliar and cumbersome to set up at first, don't worry -- speed quickly comes with repetition.

---

### Steps

1. [Create files](#filecreate)
2. Save changes to file(s)
    - `⌘ S`
3. [Open files in chrome and open chrome console](#openinchrome)
    - `⌘ TAB` to switch to Chrome, if open
    - If Chrome isn't open, `⌘ [SPACE]` to open Spotlight (Max OS X Finder Speed Search), and then type Chrome and hit enter when the Chrome icon appears

#### Create `index.html` and `script.js` Files

Creating a JS intro directory that contains an `index.html` and `script.js` file. If you already have a `wdi` directory with contains a `sandbox` directory, you can run the below Terminal commands...

```bash
cd ~/wdi/sandbox
touch index.html script.js
```

The `index.html` and `script.js` files should contain the following...

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is the Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

```js
// script.js

console.log("hello world")
```

<a name="openinchrome"></a>

---
## Open Chrome & Dev Tools

Open the javascript console with Command + Option + J (`⌘ + ⌥ + J`)

---

### The Console as a REPL

The "Console" is an example of a REPL, which is a tool for testing and debugging code. REPL is an acronym that stands for “Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop”.

Think of the REPL as being simply like scratch-paper for code. It's a small programming environment that lets us run Javascript code one line at a time.

What does it do?
  1. (**R**)eads our code.
  2. (**E**)valuates expressions.
  3. (**P**)rints the result to the console, if any (some things result in or ***return*** `undefined`).
  4. Then it (**L**)oops back to the beginning, ready to (**R**)ead the next line of code we feed it. It 'listens' for new code.

> In Chrome, `⌘ + ⌥ + i` opens the chrome dev tools. Here you can do a bunch of stuff like inspect elements and see HTML, CSS and scripts the page has loaded. It allows you to access the console which interacts with the JS that the page has loaded. In our case we'll see that interaction with the code below

## Exercises

The rest of the lesson consists of guided exercises. The goal behind these is to increase your familiarity with Javascript by analyzing the output of different Javascript expressions.

For each exercise you will be working in pairs.

### Setup

1. Clone down the [data types repo here](https://github.com/wdi-sg/js-data-types)
2. In Sublime, open [exercise.md](https://github.com/wdi-sg/js-data-types/blob/master/exercise.md). You will use this as the worksheet for the next three exercises.

## You Do: Data Types & Data Structures (25 minutes / 0:50)

Complete the **Data Types** and **Data Structures** exercises in [`exercise.md`](https://github.com/wdi-sg/js-data-types/blob/master/exercise.md)

> You can use the [Data Types And Collections](./data-types-and-collections.md) readme as reference and review.

[Pseudocode](../../01-workflow/pseudocode-lowlevel.md)
[Conditionals](js-control-flow/03booleans-and-conditionals.md)

## Getting User Input & Conditionals

**You will need to read the following sections to complete this lesson's homework assignment.**

### `.prompt()`

We've learned about basic data types, but it'd be nice if we had a way of getting user input into our browser. We'll learn some ways to use forms and such later in the course, but for now, we'll be getting user input using the `prompt()` function.

At any point in our JS code, if we write `prompt()`, a pop up box will open in our browser for a user to enter in text.

```js
// prompts user and stores value in the variable
var valueOfPrompt = prompt()
// logs value stored
console.log(valueOfPrompt)
```

You can also pass in a string as an argument to have the pop up box contain that string as a ... prompt.

```js
var age = prompt("How old are you?")
alert("You are " + age + " years old.")
```

Whatever we type into the textbox in the window that `prompt()` brings up, is **returned** by prompt to the variable `age`.

### Adding Conditionals

Let's say, we were deciding whether or not to let someone inside of a club.

```js
var age = prompt("How old are you?")
alert("You are " + age + " years old.")

if (age >= 21) {
  alert("Welcome to the club")
} else if (age < 21 && age > 0) {
  alert( "You are too young :(" )
} else {
  alert("Your age is not a number (NaN) or is negative. Invalid input.")
}
```

# Additional Notes

## Syntax

### Semicolons
- End every line with a semi-colon. JS allows code without any semi-colons, but it is bad practice.

### Comments

Comments are an extremely important part of writing code. They help us make sense of our code, especially for other people reading our code, or when we have walked away from some code and have completely forgotten what certain sections of it do. This happens much more quickly than you may imagine.

If you are working on a team, your documentation and commenting practices often translate to how easy you are to work with!

```js
// Single line comment

/*
  Multiple
  line
  comments
*/
```
