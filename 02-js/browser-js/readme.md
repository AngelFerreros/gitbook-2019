## Learning Objectives

- Describe the role Javascript plays alongside HTML and CSS
- Describe the DOM

## Framing (5 minutes / 0:05)

We've dabbled with HTML and CSS. There's a bit of interactivity we can program through CSS but not nearly enough! How can we start to add logic, data-handling and behaviors to our web apps? Enter Javascript.



#### If a web application or website were a building...

##### HTML: Structure and Content

HTML would be like the most stripped-down version of that building -- just the structure of the building, the building materials, and some content (maybe unfurnished offices, an empty classroom, a set of not-yet-operational bowling-lanes, etc).

##### CSS: Styling

CSS is responsible for the appearance of the building, adding granite floors, polished doors, wooden railings, etc. CSS styles the content of a website to look like more than just black text on a white background.

##### Javascript: Behavior & Functionality

Javascript might be like the building's elevator systems, ID-scanning & entry systems. Javascript handles interactivity and data.



## Think-Pair-Share: HTML vs JS

> 5 minutes exercise. 5 minutes review.

Look back at the pokedex html exercise. What kinds of interactions are enabled by HTML pages alone?

Open a google docs page. What interactions are enabled by HTML and what are not?


### Findings

#### Interactivity

Javascript allows us to write code that is executed in response to user interaction

#### No Refreshes ‚û° üëç User Experience

# What is the DOM?

* Abstraction layer of what is actually happening on the browser screen ( model of the document )

* Alerts javascript to changes in the state of the HTML (events)

* Allows javascript programs to change the state of the HTML and CSS (document object)

* An "API" or interface to the browser screen from javascript

* Connects the networking part to the javascript part of the browser (so that we can connect that part to the screen)
