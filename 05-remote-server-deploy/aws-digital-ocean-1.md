# Live Server

## Digital Ocean

Cloud Server for your app.

### Why we are doing this exercise
Computers connect to other computers on the Internet.

We want to get a computer in the cloud so that other people can connect to our special computer to see our content.

We also need to connect to our computer in the cloud to upload the content.


### Beforehand

1. Prepare a payment method - card or paypal

  (you will get free credits but the website registration will require those details)

### Obtain Remote Server

Goals:

1. Obtain Server
2. Get into Server - SSH


### 1. DigitalOcean Account, Free Credits

A. [Click here to enter DigitalOcean via this specific link](https://m.do.co/c/91c59e387330) to get the free credits for Digital Ocean for free access when you are learning NodeJS Express
```html
https://m.do.co/c/91c59e387330
```

B. Click on the Sign Up button

C. You will be brought to the next page.

Near the top, it should say:

<!-- ![](aws-digital-ocean/1.png) -->
<img src='aws-digital-ocean/1.png' style="width:25rem;"/>

If you saw no such message, please ask someone for assistance right now:

  * Because without that message, the free credits will not come
  * Make sure you used the link above





### 2. Proceeding Into Your Email

A. Check your email

B. Click on the link inside the email

C. On the Payment Method Verification page, enter the details into the fields.

We are using the free credits. But Digital Ocean will still require those details.

- Note: See https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/accounts/billing/
  > "DigitalOcean bills in USD. To keep our pricing stable and consistent, rather than fluctuating with exchange rates, we do not bill in local currency. Similarly, we do not invoice in local currency. All invoices are in USD."
  - So it is best to use a US credit card (uses US dollars) *if you have one* - because we want to save and have less of international currency conversion fees
  - If you don't have one yet - you can follow the method below- [How to get a USD credit card when you are physically based outside of the USA](<#How-to-get-a-USD-credit-card-when-you-are-physically-based-outside-of-the-USA>)

D. Do not touch anything on this page. Do the next step now.

### 4. Create Droplet

A. Create by using [this link - click here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?appId=48826207&size=s-1vcpu-1gb)

B. Some options to set:

* Choose a datacenter region:
  - Singapore
* Authentication
  - SSH Keys `(My Best Practice)`
  - One-Time Password (Will use for just today)
* Finalize and create
  * How many Droplets?
    - 1 Droplet

About SSH Key: https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent





### 5. Open Details

A. See your email for the details on IP Address and Password.

eg 987.654.321.987



### 6. SSH
A. Jump onto the Command Line - the Terminal - again

B. Time to do the real SSH
```bash
#SSH
ssh root@987.654.321.987
```
After that, since we chose the Password method above, we will need to paste the password.


C. After you submit, you should see this:

### 7. Final


#### Deploy Code
```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:wdi-sg/express-basic.git
cd express-basic
npm install
npm start
```

#### Visit
Visit your app. (don't forget the port)

```bas
curl <IP to your droplet>
```

Visit your site in the browser. (using the IP address)

Send the address to your app to your partner in slack.

### FURTHER

### Project Deployment

Take one of your unit 2 assignments. Deploy it to digital ocean.

Begin by cloning the app into your droplet like the example above.

Note: Depending on the assignment, you may need to use the terminal to **install** the postgres DB server.

### FURTHER

#### Terminal Shorcuts


Special commands on the command line for IP Address

Before:

Sets up the variables
```bash
echo '' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo '#Digital Ocean' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'digitalocean_addr=987.654.321.987' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```
```bash
echo alias oceanssh='ssh root@$digitalocean_addr' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

After:

Now you can use the variables
```bash
#Time to do the real SSH


# ssh root@987.654.321.987    #Numbers numbers...


ssh root@${digitalocean_addr} #Use This `ðŸš¦(My Best Practice)ðŸš¦`


# oceanssh                     #Useful but use the above for now `(Useful)`
```
Then
```bash
#After 7 below:
# ssh bossdog@987.654.321.987    #Numbers numbers...


ssh bossdog@${digitalocean_addr} #Use This `ðŸš¦(My Best Practice)ðŸš¦`
```
