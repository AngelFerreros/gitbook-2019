## Some WDI Concepts and Processes

### What is a computer
- takes intputs and produces output
- (used to take in 1s and 0s)
- now takes in in many kinds of input( music, video, text, touch, etc.)

- a computer is anything with these components
- can include many different kinds of objects today

- intel chip in 2018: 10^10 (100,000,000,000)

### What is programming, what is software

---

- used to be written on punch cards

- now uses "real" language
- writing software is a process that expresses some problem domain in a set of logical instructions for how to process inputs and outputs
- composed of abstractions (there is no real "dollars" in a bank system)
- using and making interfaces
- documents that process for other programmers working on the system
- also gives instructions to the computer
- in a professional setting **equal importance is given to how you write software as to if it runs**
- (this is why WDI places so much emphasis on soft skills vs. hard skills)

### What is the internet
- interconnected network of computers
- a way to distribute your own software to anyone connected to the network

---
#### We will be writing *software* that runs on *computers* connected to the *internet*
